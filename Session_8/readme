1. Create immutable class such that it whenever there is change made to the datamember the using some setter the value is changed by creating a new instance and setting the new value to it.
Make sure the class data members are initialized once only using constructor or block etc

Hint : Create a class with private datamember with parametric contructor such that it has getter and setter method in setter method it creates a new instance and the passed value is set to it


2.
a. Trace the output

String str1 = "Manish";
String str = new String("Manish");
if(str1 == str){
sysout("Strings are same");
}else{
sysout("Strings are not same");
}

b. 
String s = new String("Test").intern();
String s1 = new String("Test");

if(s == s1){
sysout("We are equal")
}else{
sysout("we are not equal")
}


c. 
String s1 = "Test";
String s2 = new String("Test");
if(s1.equals(s2))
{
sysout("Strings are equal")
}else{
sysout("Strings are not equal")
}
